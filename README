Description:

	Artificial Intelligence: CS 4300
	Project #4: Decision Tree Implementation

	*The task is to build a binary decision tree given a file that contains a collection of sample data.
	
	*User should then be able to enter a sample query and receive a classification that follows the decision tree logic.
	
	*Input file should look something like the following: 
		3 5
		1 1 1 0
		1 1 0 1
		0 0 1 1
		1 1 0 0
		1 0 0 1  
		
	*The first number on the first line specifies the number of attributes.
	*The second number on the first line specifies the number of samples.
	*The remaining lines contain a single sample, with attribute values seperated by a space, and 
		the final number at the end of each line specifying the classification for that sample.
	
Solution Method:

	*I used an array of structures (Sample) to store the sample data rather than C++ STL lists.
	*In an event that two outcomes are equally likely, the outcome will be determined by 50/50 random chance.
	*I followed the Decision Tree Learning Algorithm from the textbook.
	
Environment:

	*Developed with C++ using the Eclipse IDE on Windows 10 on a 64-bit Lenovo laptop.
	*See Makefile for compilation details.
	*Able to run on command line like so: ./dectree data.txt

Files:

	main.cpp:			Main driver file.
	
	sample.h: 			Declares structure for a sample.
	
	tree.cpp: 			Defines the structure for the decision tree.
	
	data.txt			A textfile containing random sample data
	
Problems:

	Checking validity of user input may not be perfect.
